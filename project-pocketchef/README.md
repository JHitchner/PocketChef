# README

PocketChef is an application that takes the horrors of writing down the ingredients from multiple recipes and converting it into an easy to-do shopping list where the user just needs to take out their mobile device to do their grocery shopping list. Recipes from PocketChef are powered by the Edamam API, which has over 1.5 Million recipes for our users to choose from.

The two creators of this app, Juliet Hitchner and Simon Chen, share their love of food and convenience of converting recipes to shopping lists as a main priority in developing this app.

Hitchner, is responsible for creating the entire backend in which the user can store their information and create their profiles, writing the logic behind the app grabbing the information from the API, and designing the layout of the pages.

Chen, is responsible for creating the background images of the pages, styling the layout of the pages, and writing the initial code for deploying the API.

PocketChef is powered by the usage of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and the Edamam API.
